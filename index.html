					<h1><span class="blue">WHAT IS</span> COMPUTER SCIENCE?</h1>
					<p>
						Computers have become the part of our daily lives that are taken for granted. 
						Many are unaware of what’s happening inside this mysterious device, and are unaware of how utilize it effectively. 
						You probably have possession of a device at home or possible carry one with you in your pockets, 
						but do you know how such an important utility in our daily life is possible?
						</br></br>
						Computer science is the study of how computers can be applied to solve real problems.
						You’ll learn how to think in a similar logic-driven manner as the computer, and implement solutions in order to solve challenges.
					</p>
					
					<br><br>
					
					<h1><span class="blue">WHY TAKE</span> COMPUTER SCIENCE?</h1>
					<p>
						There’s a growing demand for people who can apply modern technology in order to solve new challenges. 
						Studying computer science will teach you valuable problem-solving skills and help you develop a unique way of looking at new problems.
						</br></br>
						It’s worth to invest your time in learning about Computer Science even if your interest isn’t in the direction of a Computer Science major. 
						No matter where you decide to go you’ll definitely run into a situation where an understanding of computers would be of great value to you. 
						</br></br>
						If you plan to go into one of the following fields: taking a computer science course can help you get a head start and enrich your skills
						<ul>
							<li>Business</li>
							<li>Engineering</li>
							<li>Sciences</li>
							<li>Mathematics</li>
						</ul>

				<h1><span class="light_blue">CANADIAN COMPUTING</span> COMPETITION</h1>
					<p>
						Every year, the University of Waterloo hosts the Canadian Computing Competition, a programming contest open to students of all programming levels. 
						This three hour competition consists of five problems students must solve by writing a computer program that will solve it. 
						The problems range from simple operations to implementing more challenging algorithms and dynamic programming techniques. 
						The top students in each region are awarded a plaque, and students who score above a certain range will also receive special acknowledgements.
						</br></br>
						Hamber students have demonstrated top performance in the CCC, and are currently on a four year consecutive streak.
						</br>
						Majority of the students who won have achieved perfect scores in the competition.

						<h2><strong>COURSE CODE:</strong> INT10/ICTP11A</h2>
						<p>
							Junior Programming is designed for students who never had any previous experience in computer science, 
							although anyone who wants a review of the foundations are welcomed to joined. 
							Students taking this course will be introduced to fundamental concepts of programming in the Python language, 
							along with learning how to utilize the basics of a UNIX system. 
							Basic hardware concepts such as logic gates and the binary system will also be introduced. 
							By the end of the course students should have a good understanding of the following concepts:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Basic UNIX Commands</li>
							<li>Python Language Fundamentals</li>
							<li>Usage of SSH and remote logins</li>
							<li>Binary Arithmetic</li>
							<li>TCP and UDP Network Protocols</li>

							This is the next level course intended for students who have successfully completed the junior course, 
							or students that have demonstrated understanding of junior-level programming concepts. This year students will be introduced to the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. 
							Students will also be able to demonstrate their deeper understanding of programming by utilizing popular libraries such as SFML, Pygame, and pyFLTK. 
							The purpose of the intermediate course is to have students learn how to develop full applications from what they know. 
							Students should have experience in the following by the end of the year:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Object Oriented Programming concepts</li>
							<li>Utilizing and Managing Virtual Machines</li>
							<li>Libraries such as SFML, Pygame and FLTK</li>
