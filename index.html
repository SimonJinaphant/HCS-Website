					<p>
						Every year, students of all programming levels are given the opportunity to compete in the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC). 
						This three hour competition consist of five problems students must solve by developing computational solutions. 
						The difficulties ranges from applying easy computation concepts to more challenging algorithms and dynamic programming techniques. 
						The students who score the highest in each provincial groups are awarded a plaque, 
						and students who score above a certain range will also receive special acknowledgements.
						<br><br>
						Hamber students have demonstrated top performance in the CCC for a total of six times, 
						and are currently on a four year consecutive streak. 
						Majority of the students who won have achieved perfect scores in the competition.

					Hamber's Department of Computer Science offers three courses. All of these courses are taught in the Linux Lab (Room 307).<br>
					The programming languages and libraries used in class are all cross platform, so students are able to<br>
					develop and run their applications at home on different Operating Systems (Windows, Mac, Linux).

						<h2><strong>COURSE CODE:</strong> INT10/ICTP11A</h2>
						<p>
							Junior Programming is designed for students who never had any previous experience in computer science, 
							although anyone who wants a review of the foundations are welcomed to joined. 
							Students taking this course will be introduced to fundamental concepts of programming in the Python language, 
							along with learning how to utilize the basics of a UNIX system. 
							Basic hardware concepts such as logic gates and the binary system will also be introduced. 
							By the end of the course students should have a good understanding of the following concepts:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Basic UNIX Commands</li>
							<li>Python Language Fundamentals</li>
							<li>Usage of SSH and remote logins</li>
							<li>Binary Arithmetic</li>
							<li>TCP and UDP Network Protocols</li>

						<p>
							This is the next level course intended for students who have successfully completed the junior course, 
							or students that have demonstrated understanding of junior-level programming concepts. This year students will be introduced to the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. 
							Students will also be able to demonstrate their deeper understanding of programming by utilizing popular libraries such as SFML, Pygame, and pyFLTK. 
							The purpose of the intermediate course is to have students learn how to develop full applications from what they know. 
							Students should have experience in the following by the end of the year:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Object Oriented Programming concepts</li>
							<li>Utilizing and Managing Virtual Machines</li>
							<li>Libraries such as SFML, Pygame and FLTK</li>
							<li>Deeper understanding of networking</li>

						<h2><strong>COURSE CODE:</strong> ICTP12B</h2>
						<p>
							The final course offered for experienced students interested in computer science. 
							Students who are taking this course will be introduced to the C/C++ language, along with revisiting libraries such as FLTK and SFML in its native form. 
							This course involves teaching higher level programming concepts such as dynamic memory allocation and pointers. 
							Special mathematical concepts such as integration and linear matrix algebra will also be lightly introduced, giving students a head start in preparation for post-secondary. 
							Students will also learn special skills such as Linux system administration, along with micro computer programming via an Arduino.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>C/C++ Language Fundamentals</li>
							<li>Exposure to post-secondary level Mathematics</li>
							<li>Linux System Administration</li>
